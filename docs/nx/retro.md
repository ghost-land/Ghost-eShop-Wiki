## 🛠 Technical Details  

Ghost eShop RETRO NX is based on our **Tinfoil v2** infrastructure, a dedicated server system optimized for managing content on Nintendo Switch. Tinfoil v2 supports direct URL files instead of chunked files as used in the v3 system. This setup provides basic performance and sufficient compatibility with Tinfoil clients.  

The source code for our Tinfoil v2 server is available as open-source here:

This architecture ensures a smooth and reliable experience for all Ghost eShop RETRO NX users.
