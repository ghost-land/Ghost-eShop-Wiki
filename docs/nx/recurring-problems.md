### 🚫 **Error**: *Tinfoil won't start on Firmware v21+*
ℹ️ **Reason**: Starting from firmware v21, some homebrew applications like Tinfoil may not start due to changes in the system that require to update package3 file.  

> ⚠️ **Important Warning**: This solution is **not recommended** and is listed here only for users who absolutely need to access Tinfoil on firmware v21+. Manipulating the ABI in package3 is **not advised** and may cause instability or other issues.  
> **The best approach is to stay on firmware v20** and wait for either Tinfoil to be updated and recompiled, or for other homebrew solutions to become available soon.

✅ **Solution** (Use at your own risk):  
**Important**: You must first update Atmosphere, then replace package3. Replacing package3 without updating Atmosphere first will not work.  
1. **Update Atmosphere**: Ensure you have **Atmosphere 1.10.0 or higher** installed for firmware v21+ compatibility. Update your Custom Firmware (CFW) to the latest version that supports your firmware.  
2. **Replace package3**: After updating Atmosphere, replace the package3 file.  
   - Download the package3 file: **[package3](pathname:///bin/package3)**  
   - Place the `package3` file in the **`sdmc:/atmosphere/`** folder (replace the existing one if present).  
3. Restart your Switch.  
- Always check CFW compatibility before updating your Switch firmware.  
- If you encounter persistent issues, ensure you have the correct package3 file for your firmware version.
